## Introduction 
The ThreeDRNAseq (3D RNA-seq) R package is designed for use by biologists to analyze their own RNA-seq data. It provides an interactive graphical user interface (GUI) for differential expression (DE), differential alternative splicing (DAS) and differential transcript usage (DTU) (3D) analyses of RNA-seq data based on the popular pipeline limma (Ritchie et al., 2015). It also integrated transcript isoform switch tools, such as IsoKtsp (Sebestyen et al., 2015) and TSIS (Guo et al., 2017) for an enhanced alternative splicing analysis. The 3D RNA-seq removes all the unnecessary complexities associated with differential expression analysis and enables a complete RNA-seq analysis to be done quickly (3 Days, thus 3D). It allows complex experimental designs such as time-series, developmental series and multiple conditions. It employs state-of-the-art methods/statistics and generates 3D results quickly and accurately.

## Run 3D RNA-seq App
The 3D RNA-seq App docker image is hosted by the James Hutton Institute server. Open the App by this link: <a href="http://ics.hutton.ac.uk/3drnaseq" target="_blank">http://ics.hutton.ac.uk/3drnaseq </a>

To perform 3D analysis, users need to upload input data to our server. All results, reports, figures and intermediate data will be zipped and downloaded in the final step.

<a href='#table-of-contents'>Go back to Table of contents</a>

## Input files
(1) Gather the meta-data of the experimental design in a csv spreadsheet, the columns of which must include the following information (<a href='#fig_input_csv'>Figure 1A</a>):

- A column of the factor or multiple columns of the factors of the experimental design.
- A column of the biological replicate labels.
- A column of the sequencing replicate labels if they exist.
- A column of the file names of transcript quantifications.


(2) A folder that contains the transcript quantification files. Each file contains transcript quantification data of a single sample. Read counts and TPMs for 3D analysis will be generated from the "quant.sf" objects if these files are generated by Salmon (Patro et al., 2017) and the "abundance.h5"/"abundance.tsv" objects if these files are generated by Kallisto (Bray et al., 2016) (<a href='#fig_input_csv'>Figure 1B</a>).

(3)	Transcript-gene mapping file in one of the following formats:

- "csv" spreadsheet with first column of transcript IDs and second column of gene IDs (<a href='#fig_input_csv'>Figure 1C</a>).
- Or a "fa" file of the transcriptome for quantification. Transcript names and gene IDs will be extracted from the "transcript" (if it exists) or ">" tags and "gene" tags in the description lines of sequences, respectively (<a href='#fig_input_csv'>Figure 1D</a>).
- Or a "gtf" file of the transcriptome for quantification. Transcript names and gene IDs will be extracted from the "transcript_id" and "gene_id" tags in the last column, respectively (<a href='#fig_input_csv'>Figure 1E</a>). 


**Note**: 

(1) Transcript-gene mapping in "csv" file is recommended. Depending on the size, it may take a while to generate the table from a "fa" or a "gtf" file and any missing tags for transcript name and gene ID extraction in these files may lead to errors.

(2) The 3D analysis is executable in a computer with normal memory and CPU size. If the App is running on docker image, it is recommended to reduce the data size to upload to our server. Users can exclude all the files in sub-folders of transcript quantifications, except the files of "quant.sf" from Salmon. If the transcript quantifications are generated using Kallisto, users can keep either "abundance.h5" or "abundance.tsv" in the sub-folders with smaller size (<a href='#fig_input_csv'>Figure 1B</a>).

(A) Meta-data table of sample information in csv file. (B) The folder contains transcript quantifications. The input of transcript-gene mapping information can be a "csv" spreadsheet with first column of transcript names and second column of gene IDs (C), a ".fa" file (D) or a ".gtf" file (E) of the transcriptome. If a ".fa" or a ".gtf" file is provided, the App will extract transcript-gene association information with specific tags.</p>

## Output files
The results of the 3D RNA-seq analysis are saved in the App working direcotry in four folders:

(1)	"report" folder: the final report in html, pdf and word formats will be saved in the "report" folder.
(2)	"result" folder: the gene lists generated from DE, DAS and DTU analysis will be saved as csv files in the "result" folder.
(3)	"figure" folder: the figures generated and saves through the analysis will be saved in the "figure" folder.
(4)	"data" folder: the intermediate datasets of the analysis will be saved in the "data" folder in R data format (.RData). R users can open and process these objects in R software for a further personalized analysis.
The detailed descriptions of saved files can be found in "Appendix" at the end of the document.

## Example data
**Download link**:

**Description**:
This example is a sub-dataset from a time-series study of Arabidopsis plants exposed to cold (Calixto et al., 2018). RNA-seq data of 6 time-points were extracted from the whole dataset. The time-points are 3 and 6 hours after dusk at $20^oC$, the first day of transition to $4^oC$ and the fourth day of acclimation to $4^oC$ (red boxes in Figure 2). Each time-point has 3 biological replicates and each biological replicate has 3 sequencing replicates. Transcript quantifications were generated using Salmon (Patro et al., 2017) and AtRTD2-QUASI (Zhang et al., 2017) as the reference transcriptome. To further reduce the data size, the expression of  8,944 transcripts (from 2,000 genes  ) were extracted from the Salmon quantification to identify the cold response genes and transcripts at both transcriptional and AS level.

## Run analysis on 3D App
### Basic Workflow
3D RNA-seq App is made of control widgets that users can interact with and send messages to the underlying R code to perform analysis by simple clicking/dragging of the mouse (<a href='#fig_basic_structure'>Figure 3</a>). 

![](3D_App_figure/basic_structure.png)
<p id='fig_basic_structure.png'><strong>Figure 3:</strong> Basic widgets of 3D RNA-seq App. </a>

Running 3D RNA-seq just requires users to follow the steps from Tab panel 1 to 7. 

### Tab panel 1: Data generation
Users can upload input files and experimental design metafile in this tab panel. Transcript level and gene level read counts and TPMs (transcript per million reads) are generated by using the tximport R package (Soneson et al., 2016).

<u><strong>Step 1: Upload input files to 3D RNA-seq App.</strong></u>

![](3D_App_figure/data_generation_upload.png)

<br>
<u><strong>Step 2: Select the columns of factors, labels of replicates and quantification file names from meta-data table for 3D analysis.</strong></u>

![](3D_App_figure/data_generation_factor.png)

<br>
<u><strong>Step 3: Generate gene and transcript read counts and TPMs.</strong></u>

![](3D_App_figure/data_generation_tximport.png)

When the button "Run" is clicked, the process currently running will be shown at the lower right corner of the web browser. Once it is done, you can move to Tab panel 2 using the navigation menu on the left and make sure you roll your page to the very top. 

### Tab panel 2: Data pre-processing
Once the read counts and TPMs are generated, the data will go through a number of pre-processing steps . In each step, quality control plots are generated to optimise the parameters for pre-processing. If the RNA-seq data has sequencing replicates (seq-reps), they will be merged before 3D analysis according to the seq-rep labels selected by users in the meta-data table to increase sequencing depth, because seq-reps are generated by sequencing the same biological replicate multiple times (e.g. on different sequencing lanes), but they do not add much variability to the biological replicates. 

<u><strong>Step 4: Filter low expressed transcripts and genes based on expression mean-variance trend.</u></strong>

![](3D_App_figure/data_preprocessing_low.png)

<br>
<u><strong>Step 5: PCA plot and removing batch effects.</u></strong>

The PCA plot can also be used to identify whether the RNA-seq data contains batch effects, which are caused by biological replications being prepared in different, for example, laboratory conditions

In this panel, users can select and visualise different PCs based on transcript level or gene level expression of all samples or the average expression of biological replicates. The scatter points can be grouped and coloured according to different factors. Ellipses or polygons can be added to the plots to highlight the grouped clusters.

![](3D_App_figure/data_preprocessing_hasbatch.png)
![](3D_App_figure/data_preprocessing_nobatch.png)

<u><strong>Step 6: Data normalisation.</u></strong>

For unbiased comparisons across samples, read counts must be normalised. Normalisation methods such as Trimmed Mean of M-values (TMM), Relative Log Expression (RLE) and upper-quartile can be used to reduce the effect from the systematic technical biases across samples (Bullard et al., 2010). Box plots are used to visualise the expression distribution of raw read counts and normalised expression across samples.

![](3D_App_figure/data_preprocessing_norm.png)

Once the normalization is done as shown at the lower right corner on the browser, please proceed to Tab panel 3. 

### Tab panel 3: 3D analysis
<u><strong>Step 7:  Set contrast groups and perform 3D analysis.</u></strong>

A contrast group is a user-defined comparison between two samples or two groups of samples:

(1)	Pair-wise comparison of samples: e.g. B-A compares group B to group A; C-B compares group C to group B (Figure A).
(2)	Compare mean of multiple samples: e.g. (WT.A+WT.B)/2-(MU.A+MU.B)/2 compares the mean of group WT.A and WT.B to the mean of group MU.A and MU.B (Figure B).
(3)	Compare difference of two differences (interactions): e.g. (WT.A-WT.B)-(MU.A-MU.B) compares the difference ($L_2FC$) of group WT.A and WT.B to the difference ($L_2FC$) of group MU.A and MU.B (Figure B).

![](3D_App_figure/DDD_analysis_set_contrast.png)

**NOTE**: if the experimental design involves multiple factor levels, e.g. condition A, B and C are performed in wildtype (WT) and mutant (MU), respectively, these factors will be combined to generate group labels 

<br>
<u><strong>Step 8: Set statistical parameters and perform 3D analysis </u></strong>

![](3D_App_figure/DDD_analysis_perform_analysis.png)

**Significant result summary**

After the  the 3D analysis, the following information is summarized and will appear at the bottom of the page:

(1) The test statistics in different contrast groups, e.g. adjusted p-value and $L_2FC$.
(2) The number of genes and transcripts with significant expression changes in contrast groups.
(3) The number of up- and down-regulated DE genes and transcripts.
(4) The numbers of genes/transcripts regulated only by transcription (DE), only by alternative splicing (DAS/DTU) and by both transcription and alternative splicing (DE+DAS/DE+DTU).

These summaries can be filtered, customized and the figures can be saved with specified formats and sizes.

![](3D_App_figure/DDD_analysis_venn_number.png)

![](3D_App_figure/DDD_analysis_updown.png)

![](3D_App_figure/DDD_analysis_DEvsDAS.png)

### Tab panel 4: Functional plot
<u><strong>Step 9: Generating heat-maps.</u></strong>

Users can make heat-maps of significant DE genes, DAS genes, DE transcripts and DTU transcripts identified from the analysis. The heat-maps and the gene/transcript list in each cluster of the heat-maps can be saved to local folder.

![](3D_App_figure/functional_heatmap.png)

<br>
<u><strong>Step 10: Generating profiles and percent spliced plots.</u></strong>

Gene and transcript expression profiles (TPMs or read counts) and PS (percent spliced) can be visualised by typing a gene id. Users can also generate a number of plots by providing a gene list and all the plots can be saved to "figure" folder of the App working directory.

![](3D_App_figure/functional_profile.png)

<u><strong>Step 11: Generating GO enrichment plot.</u></strong>

Users can generate gene lists of DE genes, DAS genes, DE transcripts and DTU transcripts by clicking "Download gene list" button. These gene lists can be uploaded to Gene Ontology (GO) analysis tools/databases (e.g. DAVID and agriGO) to generate GO annotation. A csv file with GO annotation information is required to generate the annotation plot. The file includes a column of "Category" of CC (cellular component), BP (biological process) and MF (molecular function), a column of "Term" of GO annotation and the rest columns of statistics to report the annotation enrichment, e.g. count, -log10(FDR), etc.

![](3D_App_figure/functional_go.png)

### Tab panel 5: Isoform switch
Transcript isoform switches (ISs) occur when within a gen a pair of alternatively spliced isoforms reverse the order of their relative expression levels. **IsokTSP** is a method to detect transcript ISs between pair-wise conditions (Sebestyen et al., 2015) while **TSIS** (time-series IS) is used to identify ISs in time-series data (Guo et al., 2017).

![](3D_App_figure/TSIS.png)

<br>
<u><strong>Step 12: Perform isoform switch analysis.</u></strong>

![](3D_App_figure/tsis_parameter.png)

<br>
After the analysis is done, a number of plots will be generated automatically to visualize the results.

![](3D_App_figure/tsis_number.png)
![](3D_App_figure/tsis_plotswitch.png)

### Tab panel 5: Generate report

<u><strong>Step 12: generate report and download all the results.</u></strong>

Publication-quality reports will generated and together with figures, results and statistics of significance can be downloaded in a zipped file.

### Files in data folder
Intermediate data in .RData for 3D RAN-seq analysis are saved in the data folder. There are three .RData objects: 1) txi_trans.RData and 2) txi_genes.RData are transcript and gene level read count and TPM outputs from the tximport R package (Soneson et al., 2016). All the intermediate data generated in the process of 3D analysis is saved in the list object intermediate_data.RData. R users can access to the data using command line.
