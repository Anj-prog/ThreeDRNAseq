[2017-04-20 10:49:17.014] [jointLog] [info] Counted 21923642 total reads in the equivalence classes 
[2017-04-20 10:49:17.026] [jointLog] [warning] 0.0077134% of fragments were shorter than the k used to build the index (31).
If this fraction is too large, consider re-building the index with a smaller k.
The minimum read size found was 20.
