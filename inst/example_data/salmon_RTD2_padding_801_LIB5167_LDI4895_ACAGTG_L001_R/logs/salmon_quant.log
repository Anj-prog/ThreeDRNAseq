[2017-04-20 09:59:15.643] [jointLog] [info] Counted 16410772 total reads in the equivalence classes 
[2017-04-20 09:59:15.650] [jointLog] [warning] 0.00852215% of fragments were shorter than the k used to build the index (31).
If this fraction is too large, consider re-building the index with a smaller k.
The minimum read size found was 20.
