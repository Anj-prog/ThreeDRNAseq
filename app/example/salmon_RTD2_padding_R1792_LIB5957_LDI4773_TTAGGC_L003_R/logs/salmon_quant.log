[2017-04-20 11:38:32.612] [jointLog] [info] Counted 17078162 total reads in the equivalence classes 
[2017-04-20 11:38:32.622] [jointLog] [warning] 0.00695032% of fragments were shorter than the k used to build the index (31).
If this fraction is too large, consider re-building the index with a smaller k.
The minimum read size found was 20.
