[2017-04-20 12:08:24.746] [jointLog] [info] Counted 21441628 total reads in the equivalence classes 
[2017-04-20 12:08:24.754] [jointLog] [warning] 0.00676735% of fragments were shorter than the k used to build the index (31).
If this fraction is too large, consider re-building the index with a smaller k.
The minimum read size found was 20.
